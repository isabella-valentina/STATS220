# STATS220
This is my repo for the STATS220 Data Technologies course.  

STATS220 focuses on the use of [R programming](https://www.r-project.org/) to become familiar with and carry out various data processes. I've created this repo as required to complete my first project and I'll be adding my future work throughout the semester.
