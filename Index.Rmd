## My meme
I decided to focus on my happy reaction when I realised that part of this project was creating our own meme. I chose this idea as it's relevant and original, being based off of my own experience with this assignment.

I wanted to create a GIF that showed a process, and immediately thought of a plant growing. I wanted to add to it to make it more original, so included a quote and made changes to saturation to create a more meaningful animation.
